# Azzy's zapret lists

Domain and IP lists I use for [zapret-discord-youtube](https://github.com/Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube) ([-linux](https://github.com/Sergeydigl3/zapret-discord-youtube-linux)).

## How to use

1. Replace corresponding list files in zapret's directory with the ones from this repository.
2. Restart zapret.
3. Enjoy free internet with listed sites!

You can also append my files' content into yours and add more domains or IPs.
